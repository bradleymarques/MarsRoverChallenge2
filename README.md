Mars Rover Challenge Version 2 A secret mission to send a Rover to perform geological surveys on the Martian surface has just been leaked by anonymous NASA scientists. With only a few days before the deployment probe reaches the surface of Mars, disaster has struck: a freak solar flare has scrambled the memory of the Rover, and all its programming has been erased! In the leak, NASA scientists are appealing to hackers, programmers, and engineers across the globe to reproduce the Roverâ€™s source code. It is vital that this happens before the Rover touches down on the Martian surface. The ETA for Rover deployment is: Friday 9th June, 2017, 23h59 Earth-time. They require the Rover to autonomously control itself (it will be too far from Earth to make manual control a feasible option), and to survey as much of the Martian surface as possible, before hardware failure. The Rover will eventually fail, as it will run out of energy storage.
